#	Title: Edge Detection Operations
#

#
#	Function: imgHomogeneityEdgeDetection
#		Enhace image's edge by the homogeneity method. It uses a 3x3 matrix to determine the
#		current pixel value (by getting the maximum value between the distances of the pixel
#		and its neighbors)
#
#	Parameters:
#		imgdata - The input image
#		bias - Value to be added to each pixel after method is applied (used to correct some expected
#			behaviour). This value is optional (default = 32)
#
#	Returns:
#		The image whose edges has been enhaced
#		
#	See also:
#		<imgDifferenceEdgeDetection>
#
imgHomogeneityEdgeDetection <- function(imgdata, bias=32){
	.edgeDetection(imgdata, bias, "homogeneityEdgeDetection")
}

#
#	Function: imgDifferenceEdgeDetection
#		Enhace image's edge by the difference method. It uses a 3x3 matrix to determine the
#		current pixel value (by getting the maximum value between the distances of matrix's
#		opposite neighbors)
#
#	Parameters:
#		imgdata - The input image
#		bias - Value to be added to each pixel after method is applied (used to correct some expected
#			behaviour)
#
#	Returns:
#		ret - The image whose edges has been enhaced
#		
#	See also:
#		<imgHomogeneityEdgeDetection>
